# Simple-Neural-Network-Algorithm-Python

A simple python program that implements Neural Network Algorithm to perform classification using feed forward and back propagation passes on small test data set

## What is Aritificial Neural Network?
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it.

Hereâ€™s a diagram of what one node might look like.
